# ⚡ SkewX - Data Skew Optimizer

**SkewX** is a real-time Spark job analyzer that detects **data skew** using **Zipf's Law** and provides actionable **optimization suggestions**. It helps identify uneven data distributions that can slow down distributed systems — empowering data engineers with fast diagnostics and smarter tuning strategies.

## 🔎 Problem it Solves

In distributed systems like Spark, **data skew** causes some partitions to be overloaded while others remain underutilized — leading to:
- Slower jobs ⏱️
- Inefficient resource usage 💸
- Pipeline failures 🔥

**SkewX** solves this by:
- Parsing Spark logs
- Analyzing key distributions
- Detecting skew using **Zipf coefficient**
- Recommending rebalancing strategies

## 🚀 Features

✅ Upload Spark logs in `.json`, `.csv`, or `.txt`  
✅ Detect data skew based on **Zipf distribution**  
✅ Visualize top keys and frequency heatmaps  
✅ Get **real optimization suggestions**  
✅ Download results as CSV  
✅ Clean, interactive dashboard powered by Streamlit
